## Smart Course Recommender System using AI & Machine Learning
## Title of the Project
### Personalized Learning Recommendation System Using Collaborative and Content-based Filtering

EduAI is an AI-driven smart course recommender system designed to deliver personalized learning suggestions based on user interests, preferences, and learning behavior. The system leverages machine learning algorithms to recommend relevant courses, improving learning efficiency and engagement in digital education platforms.

### About

The rapid growth of online learning platforms has created an overload of educational content, making it difficult for learners to identify suitable courses. Most existing platforms rely on generic recommendations that fail to adapt to individual learner needs.

EduAI addresses this challenge by integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques to analyze learner data and generate personalized course recommendations. The system evaluates user inputs such as interests, selected domains, and interaction patterns to predict the most relevant learning paths.

The proposed solution employs multiple machine learning models including Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and XGBoost, combined with hybrid filtering techniques. A modern web-based interface ensures ease of use while maintaining scalability and performance.

EduAI aims to enhance learner satisfaction, reduce search effort, and support data-driven personalized education.
